raw_data observations:

0:Tall 14000 narrow, peakjust over 100, very small bump to right, at around 1/7s up
1:Peak around 1000, narrow but with small bump to left about 1/2 up and small bump to right 1/10 up
2:Tall narrow, smooth, noise to left, tiny curved bump to right
3:Galvinised steel
4:Tall, very narrow, peak to right 1/7 up, separate small bump to left, tiny kink to right at about 160
5:SHarp small peak to right 1/5th up, larger peak below 100, separate kink to right at about 120
6:MO? Wide, noisy and curved low down, peak below 100, second distinct peak to left at around 80, hump to right at around 120
7: High second peak at 7/9ths
8: Tall, narrow, small second peak to the right 2/3s up

aims:
analyse the emission and fluorescent spectra of several metals -  broad Bremsstrahlung and characteristic emissions
determine the composition of various metals alloys

functions:

callibration function - match two values to two other values to return the m and c parameters of a y=mx+c equation.

peak-finding function - specify min and max x values of range, take max yvalue.

count rate function - integrate counts over the whole spectrum and divide 
by count (or measuring) time

full width at half maximum function - Peak widths will reflect the resolution of the equipment used and perhaps the presence 
of multiple contributions to what appears to be a single peak. We currently have a working 
assumption that these do not change but this has not yet been confirmed one way or the 
other.



Guassian peak modelling function - model relevant spectra as a series of Gaussian peaks.See “C.3 Non-linear curve fitting of data”

peak areas - 

chemical composition function/relative intensities - To determine alloy composition, it is also necessary to know the relative strength of the 
contributions - a combination of the atomic response to the source spectrum and the system (instrumental) response.





Peak intensities vary with Z (see 1.2.2-4 in the “X-ray physics background 
information” section earlier in the lab book
